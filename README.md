# Nearby 3

[UPDATE] Nearby 3 comes with a better UI and responsiveness.

Share files seemlessly within 2 or more devices, like share images from mobile to pc, copy text from pc to mobile, share documents on the go and do more...
A simple ecosystem embedded in web-app.

> The new version 3 comes with more responsive and more attractive user interface which auto-adjusts itself according to the screen size.
